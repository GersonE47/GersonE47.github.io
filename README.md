# Gerson Escalante  

Hello There!, 

I am an ambitious, career-focused individual  seeking a full-time position that offers professional challenges utilizing interpersonal skills, excellent time management and critical thinking skills while achieving company goals. Seeking a role where I can leverage my education & experience into creating written materials to help engage customers and build brand awareness/productivity. An organized and dependable candidate successful at managing multiple priorities with a cheerful outlook. 
Throughout the course of my educational and work career I have familiarized myself with a few different applications/software included within Salesforce, Workday, Kronos, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Office 365 applications. Within Office 365 I have used Microsoft word to create documents with multiple styles for manual projects, proposals, memos, and other tight deadline projects. Cycling through & inputting data for product SKU numbers in Excel for work at my current job. I have also used Teams, PowerPoint, SharePoint, and Planner in both school and work settings for multiple reasons and projects. In Visual Studio Code I have spent time learning the features of the editor by coding beginner/intermediate projects in the computer languages of C/C++, and Python. The time I have spent in class and working full-time has helped me sharpen my ability to work and manage multiple projects under pressure, within multiple teams both professionally and efficiently. Thank you for reviewing my resume, certifications, and credentials. I look forward to connecting!
